# NOT READY

the reason I have put a repo up for this is so I can have all my progress documented, and so I guess my friends can view the code.. the project is NOT ready yet, I am constantly adding new features. The idea of the FTP is so it will allow 1 click instalations of resources/plugins onto your FiveM (gta 5 RP) server.

# EzyFTP
an easy to use, FTP client 

## current dependencies/credits:

### Directory tree styled viewing API: https://github.com/TomasMikula/LiveDirsFX

### FTP connection, transfer, disconnection and FTP error generation: https://www.chilkatsoft.com/java-ftp.asp

### Original FTP API: https://github.com/venson999/EasyFTP (also including Apache commons) but I have moved onto chilkat instead for better error logging and such, I could read some Apache commons FTP documentation but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Notification displaying: https://controlsfx.bitbucket.io/org/controlsfx/control/Notifications.html

###### please note that most of this was done on my first few days ever of learning Java, so expect more to come :)
